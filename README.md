# MOTIVOTE - SERVER #

Detailed tutorial: http://rspserver.com/motivote

1.3 (until I automatically create a jar for you again)
You will need to add simple-json library to your server's libraries.
You will need to copy over the src folder into your src folder.

	/src/ (your server's source folder)
	/src/com/rs/server (for example)
	/src/com/rspserver/motivote (the com folder copied into your src folder)
	
	NOT /src/com/rs/server/src/com/rspserver/motivote
